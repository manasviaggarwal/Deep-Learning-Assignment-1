# DeepLearning assignment 1

This is the first assignment of Deep Learning course 2020. In this assignment we deal with two parts:

#PART 1:

In this part we have to make a python program to test if the number is divisible by 3 then the output
should be Fizz and if number is divisible by 5 then the output is Buzz and if the number is divisible
by 15 then the output should be FizzBuzz and if not divisible by 3 and 5 the the number should be
in the output. As there are no hyper-parameters to be learned in this program so no need for training.

#PART 2:

In this we have to train a pytorch neural network model which is tained on some samples and tested on some
other samples. The current model has 2 layers (excluding the input layer) and activation function
used is Relu. Number of hidden units are 150. On training set the accuracy is 99-100% and test set
also the saved model shows 100% accuracy. That means all are correctly labeled either Fizz, Buzz,
FizzBuzz.
